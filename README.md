Cake-yaml provides possibility to configure CakePHP 3 routes with simple yaml files. This is basically just wrapper for CakePHP core routing that parses yaml files and makes proper calls to Cake\Core\Router.

Main goal is not to implement all fancy features that CakePHP 3 routing provides, only those ones that are really needed. Of course this is relative to developer, so feel free to fork and commit your own code.

### Installation ###

```composer require makallio85/cake-yaml "dev-master"```

### Usage ###

1. Replace all contents in ```config/routes.php``` file with single method call ```CakeYaml\Generator::getInstance()->run()```
2. Load all plugins by calling ```CakeYaml\Plugin::getInstance()->load($plugin, $options)```  Method is basically just wrapper for ```Cake\Core\Plugin::load()``` method. Note that ```Cake\Core\Plugin::loadAll()``` method is not supported and all plugins should be loaded one at time.
3. Add your own route to ```routes.yml``` files to your project and desired plugins.

### About route configuration ###

Every route is automatically named with its key. Root route should be named as root by convention.
Route can contain path and config keys. Path is always string but config can be string that references to another yaml file that contains configuration. Syntax for external path is "PluginName.RouteFileName". All route configurations should be placed in config folder of project or plugin.

Possible keys for config are listed below:

| Key        | Type            | Description                   |
|:-----------|:----------------|:------------------------------|
| controller | string          | Route controller              |
| action     | string          | Route action                  |
| plugin     | string          | Route plugin                  |
| _method    | array or string | Route method                  |
| extensions | array           | Allowed extensions            |
| routes     | array           | Subroutes                     |
| validate   | array           | List of variables to validate |

Note that ```routes``` key can contain all keys above except routes. Meaning that subroute can't have subroute.

### Examples ###

##### Basic routing #####
```config/routes.yml``` like this
```
root:
  path: /
```

Turns into this

```
\Cake\Routing\Router::scope('/', [], function ($routes) {
	$routes->fallbacks('DashedRoute');
});

\Cake\Core\Plugin::routes();
```

##### Plugin Routing #####

```PluginCars/config/routes.yml``` like this

```
cars:
  path: /cars
  config:
    plugin: PluginCars
    controller: Cars
    action: index
    extensions:
      - json
      - xml
    routes:
      bmws_list:
        path: /bmws
        controller: Bmws
      bmws_view:
        _method: GET
        path: /bmws/{id}
        controller: Bmws
        action: view
        validate:
          id: '[0-9]+'
      bmws_add:
        _method: POST
        path: /bmws/add
        controller: Bmws
        action: add
      ladas:
        path: /ladas
        controller: Ladas
```

Turns into this

```
\Cake\Routing\Router::plugin('PluginCars', ['path' => '/cars'], function ($routes) {
	$routes->extensions(['0' => 'json', '1' => 'xml']);
	$routes->connect('/', ['plugin' => 'PluginCars', 'controller' => 'Cars', 'action' => 'index'], ['_name' => 'cars']);
	$routes->connect('/bmws', ['path' => '/bmws', 'controller' => 'Bmws'], ['_name' => 'bmws_list']);
	$routes->connect('/bmws/:id', ['_method' => 'GET', 'path' => '/bmws/{id}', 'controller' => 'Bmws', 'action' => 'view'], ['_name' => 'bmws_view', 'pass' => ['0' => 'id'], 'id' => '[0-9]+']);
	$routes->connect('/bmws/add', ['_method' => 'POST', 'path' => '/bmws/add', 'controller' => 'Bmws', 'action' => 'add'], ['_name' => 'bmws_add']);
	$routes->connect('/ladas', ['path' => '/ladas', 'controller' => 'Ladas'], ['_name' => 'ladas']);
	$routes->fallbacks('DashedRoute');
});

\Cake\Core\Plugin::routes();
```

### Debugging ###

If you want to debug generated routes, you can set debug parameter to true when calling ```CakeYaml\Generator::getInstance()->run(true)```.
After that, you are able to get executed calls by calling ```CakeYaml\Generator::getInstance()->getDump()```.

### toDo ###

- Add support for true inheritance by allowing subroute to contain subroute
- ~~Add tests~~ Add more tests
- Refactor classes
- ~~Add support for extensions~~
- Improve exception handling
